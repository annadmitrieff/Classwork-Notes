### **S2 Free-Response Questions**

- **1) Suppose a supersonic airplane flies at a speed of 1,650 km/hr from Nairobi, Kenya, to Quito, Ecuador; note that this is the same speed that Earth rotates, but in the opposite direction. Describe how this flight would look to an observer on the Moon.**
  - The airplane would appear to lift off the ground and stand still while the Earth rotates beneath it.

- **2) Describe at least three pieces of evidence supporting the special theory of relativity.**
  - Hafele & Keating's atomic clocks.
  - $\pi ^+$ mesons' lifespans at high velocities in particle accelerators.
  - Validations of $E = mc^2$ (nuclear bombs, etc).

- **3a) Recall that a π+ meson produced at rest has a lifetime of 18 billionths of a second. Thus, in its own reference frame, a π+ meson will always "think" it is at rest and therefore decay after 18 billionths of a second (1.8 × 10-8 s). Suppose a π+ meson is produced in a particle accelerator traveling at 0.998c. According to scientists in the lab, how long will the π+ meson last compared to its normal lifetime of 18 billionths of a second (e.g., shorter, the same, or longer)?**
  - In the lab's reference frame, time will appear slowed for the $\pi ^ +$ meson and thus its lifetime will seem longer.

- **3b) Recall that the time dilation formula is: $$t = \dfrac{t'}{\sqrt{1 - (\dfrac{v}{c})^2}}$$ where *t* is the time in the laboratory and *t'* is the time for the moving particle. Use the time dilation formula to calculate how long scientists will see the $\pi ^{+}$ meson last before it decays.**
  - $$t = \dfrac{1.8 \times 10^{-8}}{\sqrt{1 - (0.998)^2}} \approx 2.847 \times 10^{-7}s$$

-  **4) Suppose you stay home on Earth while your twin sister takes a trip to a distant star and back in a spaceship that travels at 99 percent of the speed of light. If both of you are 25 years old when she leaves and you are 45 years old when she returns, how old is your sister when she gets back?**
  - Recall the time dilation formula: $$t' = t\sqrt{1-(\dfrac{v}{c})^2}$$
  - We compute: $$t' = 20 \sqrt{1 - (0.99)^2} \approx 2.8yrs$$

-  **5) A clever student decides to spend time cruising around the local solar neighborhood at a speed of 0.95c (95 percent of the speed of light). How much time will pass on her spacecraft during a period in which 70 years pass on Earth?**
  - Recall the time dilation formula: $$t' = t \sqrt{1 - (\dfrac{v}{c})^2} = 70 \sqrt{1 - (0.95)^2} = 21.8 yrs$$

-  **6) Julia is traveling away from you at 0.95c when she shoots a probe forward from her spacecraft. According to her, the probe travels at 0.8c. How fast do you see the probe going?**
  - Recall the formula: $$v_{combined} = \dfrac{v_{1}+v_{2}}{1 + \dfrac{v_1 \times v_2}{c^2}} = \dfrac{0.95c + 0.8c}{1 + \dfrac{0.95c \times 0.8c}{c^2}} \approx 0.994318c$$
  

-  **7) Explain why relativity allows us to travel, in principle, to the center of the Milky Way, but we would never be able to tell our friends back home about it.**
  - If you were to travel to the center of the Milky Way, you would have to do so at a speed comparable to the speed of light. Because the Milky Way is 25,400-ish light years across, even if we travelled at the speed of light, everyone home would be dead.

### **S3 Free-Response Questions**

- **1a) Suppose you stay home on Earth and watch a spaceship that leaves on a long trip at a constant acceleration of 1g. At an acceleration of 1g, approximately how long will it take before you see the ship traveling away from Earth at half the speed of light? Explain.**
  - Recall that $\vec{v} = \vec{a}t.$ Therefore $t = \dfrac{\vec{v}}{\vec{a}} = \dfrac{0.5 \times 3 \times 10^{8}}{9.81} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{7}s$

- **1b) Describe how you will see its speed change as it continues to accelerate. Will it keep gaining speed at a rate of 9.8 m/s each second? Why or why not?**
  - As the ship continues to accelerate, time dialation will make the time on the ship appear slower and slower, making it seem like it might not even be increasing in speed.

- **1c) Suppose the ship travels to a star that is 500 light-years away. According to you back on Earth, approximately how long will this trip take? Explain.**
  - Since the ship will be travelling very close to the speed of light, from the point of view of someone on Earth, it will appear to take 500 years to reach the star 500 lightyears away.

- **2) In your own words, explain what we mean by spacetime.**
  - The combination of the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a four-dimensional model used to understand the reletavistic effects of its warping.

- **3) Briefly explain how the universe can be finite yet have no center and no edges.**
  - We can imagine it as a balloon surface: as the balloon expands, the surface is expanding into itself. There is no center to the balloon's surface and no edge, but it is still finite.

- **4) Describe two observational tests that support general relativity.**
  - Experiments that demonstrate the weightlessness of freefall and show that it is comparable to floating freely in space.
  - Gravitational lensing in Webb and Hubble's photos.

- **5) What is *gravitational lensing?* According to general relativity, why does it occur?**
  - Gravitational lensing is the distortion of distant objects due to the warping of spacetime due to gravity. It occurs because light passing through this distorted spacetime warps with the spacetime.

- **6) What are gravitational waves? Have they ever been detected?**
  - Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by the motion of massive objects, e.g. the rotation of neutron stars in a binary neutron star system. They have not been detected, but evidence of them has been seen in the decaying of neutron stars' orbits (they must be losing and converting their angular kinetic energy somehow, causing the orbits to decay).
