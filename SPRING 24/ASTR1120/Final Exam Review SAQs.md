### **S2 Free-Response Questions**

- **1) Suppose a supersonic airplane flies at a speed of 1,650 km/hr from Nairobi, Kenya, to Quito, Ecuador; note that this is the same speed that Earth rotates, but in the opposite direction. Describe how this flight would look to an observer on the Moon.**
  - The airplane would appear to lift off the ground and stand still while the Earth rotates beneath it.

- **2) Describe at least three pieces of evidence supporting the special theory of relativity.**
  - Hafele & Keating's atomic clocks.
  - $\pi ^+$ mesons' lifespans at high velocities in particle accelerators.
  - Validations of $E = mc^2$ (nuclear bombs, etc).

- **3a) Recall that a π+ meson produced at rest has a lifetime of 18 billionths of a second. Thus, in its own reference frame, a π+ meson will always "think" it is at rest and therefore decay after 18 billionths of a second (1.8 × 10-8 s). Suppose a π+ meson is produced in a particle accelerator traveling at 0.998c. According to scientists in the lab, how long will the π+ meson last compared to its normal lifetime of 18 billionths of a second (e.g., shorter, the same, or longer)?**
  - In the lab's reference frame, time will appear slowed for the $\pi ^ +$ meson and thus its lifetime will seem longer.

- **3b) Recall that the time dilation formula is: $$t = \dfrac{t'}{\sqrt{1 - (\dfrac{v}{c})^2}}$$ where *t* is the time in the laboratory and *t'* is the time for the moving particle. Use the time dilation formula to calculate how long scientists will see the $\pi ^{+}$ meson last before it decays.**
  - $$t = \dfrac{1.8 \times 10^{-8}}{\sqrt{1 - (0.998)^2}} \approx 2.847 \times 10^{-7}s$$

-  **4) Suppose you stay home on Earth while your twin sister takes a trip to a distant star and back in a spaceship that travels at 99 percent of the speed of light. If both of you are 25 years old when she leaves and you are 45 years old when she returns, how old is your sister when she gets back?**
  - Recall the time dilation formula: $$t' = t\sqrt{1-(\dfrac{v}{c})^2}$$
  - We compute: $$t' = 20 \sqrt{1 - (0.99)^2} \approx 2.8yrs$$

-  **5) A clever student decides to spend time cruising around the local solar neighborhood at a speed of 0.95c (95 percent of the speed of light). How much time will pass on her spacecraft during a period in which 70 years pass on Earth?**
  - Recall the time dilation formula: $$t' = t \sqrt{1 - (\dfrac{v}{c})^2} = 70 \sqrt{1 - (0.95)^2} = 21.8 yrs$$

-  **6) Julia is traveling away from you at 0.95c when she shoots a probe forward from her spacecraft. According to her, the probe travels at 0.8c. How fast do you see the probe going?**
  - Recall the formula: $$v_{combined} = \dfrac{v_{1}+v_{2}}{1 + \dfrac{v_1 \times v_2}{c^2}} = \dfrac{0.95c + 0.8c}{1 + \dfrac{0.95c \times 0.8c}{c^2}} \approx 0.994318c$$
  

-  **7) Explain why relativity allows us to travel, in principle, to the center of the Milky Way, but we would never be able to tell our friends back home about it.**
  - If you were to travel to the center of the Milky Way, you would have to do so at a speed comparable to the speed of light. Because the Milky Way is 25,400-ish light years across, even if we travelled at the speed of light, everyone home would be dead.

### **S3 Free-Response Questions**

- **1a) Suppose you stay home on Earth and watch a spaceship that leaves on a long trip at a constant acceleration of 1g. At an acceleration of 1g, approximately how long will it take before you see the ship traveling away from Earth at half the speed of light? Explain.**
  - Recall that $\vec{v} = \vec{a}t.$ Therefore $t = \dfrac{\vec{v}}{\vec{a}} = \dfrac{0.5 \times 3 \times 10^{8}}{9.81} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{7}s$

- **1b) Describe how you will see its speed change as it continues to accelerate. Will it keep gaining speed at a rate of 9.8 m/s each second? Why or why not?**
  - As the ship continues to accelerate, time dialation will make the time on the ship appear slower and slower, making it seem like it might not even be increasing in speed.

- **1c) Suppose the ship travels to a star that is 500 light-years away. According to you back on Earth, approximately how long will this trip take? Explain.**
  - Since the ship will be travelling very close to the speed of light, from the point of view of someone on Earth, it will appear to take 500 years to reach the star 500 lightyears away.

- **2) In your own words, explain what we mean by spacetime.**
  - The combination of the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a four-dimensional model used to understand the reletavistic effects of its warping.

- **3) Briefly explain how the universe can be finite yet have no center and no edges.**
  - We can imagine it as a balloon surface: as the balloon expands, the surface is expanding into itself. There is no center to the balloon's surface and no edge, but it is still finite.

- **4) Describe two observational tests that support general relativity.**
  - Experiments that demonstrate the weightlessness of freefall and show that it is comparable to floating freely in space.
  - Gravitational lensing in Webb and Hubble's photos.

- **5) What is *gravitational lensing?* According to general relativity, why does it occur?**
  - Gravitational lensing is the distortion of distant objects due to the warping of spacetime due to gravity. It occurs because light passing through this distorted spacetime warps with the spacetime.

- **6) What are gravitational waves? Have they ever been detected?**
  - Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by the motion of massive objects, e.g. the rotation of neutron stars in a binary neutron star system. They have not been detected, but evidence of them has been seen in the decaying of neutron stars' orbits (they must be losing and converting their angular kinetic energy somehow, causing the orbits to decay).

### **18 Free-Response Questions**

- **1) Could our Sun ever undergo a nova or a white-dwarf supernova event? Why or why not?**
  - No: although our Sun could turn into a white-dwarf as it is a main sequence star with mass $M_{sun}$, it is not a binary star. White dwarf supernovae only occur in binary star systems.

- **2) Why does the size of a white dwarf decrease with increasing mass?**
  - As the mass of a white dwarf increases, the force of gravity holding it together strengthens as well. Electron degeneracy pressure can only resist it so much, and thus the white dwarf becomes smaller and denser.

- **3) Briefly describe how a nova event occurs.**
  - A white dwarf nova event occurs when a white dwarf in a binary system accrues enough material from its binary companion that its mass exceeds $1.4M_{sun}$. After it exceeds this limit, the Chandrasekhar limit, the hydrogen undergoes fusion due to the failure of electron degeneracy pressure in resisting the force of gravity, generating the nova.
 
- **4) Why do white-dwarf supernovae all have the same maximum luminosity?**
  - All white-dwarf supernovae occur in white dwarf binary systems where the white dwarf's mass has exceeded $1.4M_{sun}$, the Chandrasekhar limit. Since the mass of white dwarfs becoming supernovae is the same, the explosion's maximum luminosity (contingent on energy) is also approximately the same.

- **5) What is an x-ray bursar? What causes the x-ray bursts?**
  - An x-ray bursar is a neutron star in a close binary system. The x-ray bursts are caused by helium fusion taking place on the neutron star's surface.

- **6) What would happen if a small piece (say the size of a paper clip) of neutron star material struck Earth?**
  - Even a small piece of neutron star material is denser than the Earth can handle. The piece of neutron star would tunnel to the centre of the Earth. It wouldn't stop there, though, because its momentum would cause it to plunge through to the other side back and forth and back and forth, oscillating until it reached an equilibrium position at the core.

- **7) Suppose you find an X-ray binary that exhibits X-ray bursts. Is it possible that the system's X- ray binary consists of a red giant and a black hole? Why or why not?**
  - No: a black hole has no surface. X-ray bursts occur on a surface, such as the surface of an x-ray bursar.

- **8) Briefly describe what you would see if your friend plunged into a black hole.**
  - As our friend approaches the event horizon, and eventually passes it, they would be spaghettified by the black hole's tidal forces. Their time would run slower and slower relative to us, and there will come a point where it seems as if their time stands still upon crossing the event horizon or Schwarzchild radius of the black hole. Eventually, he would disappear from our view, not because we'd be able to see him get sucked in, but because his light would be so redshifted that it would no longer be in the visible light spectrum.

- **9) Why would Earth's orbit be unaffected were the Sun to suddenly become a black hole?**
  - Earth's orbit would be unaffected if the Sun suddenly became a black hole because the Earth is outside the Sun's Schwarzschild radius. Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation would apply in this case, and the Earth would simply orbit the Sun/black hole instead of being sucked in.

- **10) What is the evidence that gamma-ray bursts originate from beyond the Milky Way Galaxy?**
  - The evidence that gamma-ray bursts originate froom beyond the Milky Way lies within their distribution. Unlike the distribution of other celestial phenomena, such as neutron stars, x-ray binaries, and so on, gamma ray bursts are distributed uniformly across the sky and at further distances (at the positions and redshifts of distant galaxies). 

### **19 Free-Response Questions**
- **1) Suppose you discovered a star made purely of hydrogen and helium. How old do you think it would be? Explain.**
  - A star made purely of hydrogen and helium would probably be from the first generation of stars that was born before heavier elements and metals were dispersed into the universe.

- **2) Nebulae that scatter light are bluer than the stars that illuminate them. Earth's sky is bluer than the Sun. Is this a coincidence? Explain why or why not.**
  - Blue light scatters more easily than red light. It's not a coincidence that the sky is bluer than the sun; the red light emitted by the Sun passes more easily through the atmosphere.

- **3) The average speed of stars relative to the Sun in the solar neighborhood is about 20 km/s. Suppose you discover a star in the solar neighborhood that is moving relative to the Sun at a much higher speed, say, 200 km/s. What kind of orbit does this star probably have around the Milky Way? In what part of the galaxy does it spend most of its time? Explain.**
  - This star is probably not orbiting along the plane/disk of the Milky Way like the Sun and other stars. This star is probably a halo star, with an orbit not confined to the galaxy's disk.

- **4) Briefly describe the star-gas-star cycle.**
  - A star forms from a cold, dense dust cloud. During its lifetime, it fuses hydrogen into helium and helium into carbon. If the star is more massive, it may also create heavier and heavier elements, up to iron (which cannot produce energy through nuclear fusion) and uranium during supernova events. When the star dies, either becoming a planetary nebula or a supernova, these elements are distributed into the interstellar medium. This medium eventually goes on to form cold, dense molecular clouds, which forms new stars. 

- **5) Briefly explain why stars that formed early in the history of the galaxy contain a smaller proportion of heavy elements than stars that formed more recently.**
  - Stars that formed early in the history of the galaxy formed from molecular clouds with a smaller (or nonexistent) proportion of heavy elements/metals in them, because those elements hadn't been formed through nuclear fusion as a part of the star-gas-star cycle yet.

- **6) Explain why, in space, "no one can hear you scream."**
  - Space is a vacuum, and sound doesn't travel in a vacuum. There are too few particles distributed throughout space to oscillate with the soundwave to carry that sound.

- **7) What evidence suggests that we live inside a *hot local bubble?***
  - X-ray telescopes reveal that we're surrounded by hot, x-ray emitting gas coming from all around us. Surrounding this hot gas lies a region of cooler gas that suggests multiple supernovae have detonated within our stellar neighborhood over the last several million years, implying that we and our stellar neighbors live inside a hot bubble. Our bubble is called the *Local Bubble!*

- **8) What produces the striking red, blue, and black colors of ionization nebulae?**
  - The red, blue, and black colors of ionization nebulae are produced by emission lines, reflected starlight, and dense gas clouds. The red color is produced by the single line transition of hydrogen in which an electron falls from an energy level of 3 to 2, the blue light is produced by scattered starlight, and the black regions are produced by dark, dense gas clouds that obscure light from stars behind them.

- **9) Astronomers observe huge bubbles of hot gas, some over a thousand light-years across, in the Milky Way. What is their cause?**
  - These massive hot gas bubbles form as a product of multiple supernovae occuring in a nearby vicinity. Stars form in clusters, so this isn't a particularly unusual phenomenon. Superbubbles form from the interstellar medium and expelled 'star stuff' being pushed into a bubble-like shape from cumulative supernovae.

- **10) Why do spiral arms have a blue color?**
  - Spiral arms of galaxies have a blue color because new star formation is concentrated in these regions of the galaxies. More collisions occur in these denser areas which, in turn, also leads to more star formation.

### **20 Free-Response Questions**
- **1) Explain how we estimate that there are about 50-100 billion galaxies in the observable
universe.**
  - We can't count all of the galaxies in the extended universe, but we can take the same approach as counting all the blades of grass in a football field. By taking a snapshot with a telescope such as Hubble or Webb and counting the number of galaxies in that snapshot, then multiplying that number by the number of snapshots we would need to take to cover the whole sky, we can make an estimate of the number of galaxies in our vicinity.

- **2) Summarize the links in the distance chain that allow us to estimate distances to the farthest reaches of the universe.**
  - We can determine the distance to solar system objects through radar ranging. This gives an accurate distance to the Sun, enabling us to use parallax to measure distances to nearby stars.
  - We can use the nearby Hyades star cluster, which we can evaluate the distance to using parallax, to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with the luminosities of their main sequence.
  - We can fit further star clusters to this Hertzsprung-Russell diagram by main-sequence fitting. From this, we can evaluate distances to Cepheid variable stars.
  - We can use Cepheid variable stars' periods to measure distances to other Cepheids, enabling us to use standard candles to identify phenomena in other galaxies.
  - Once we've determined distances to other galaxies, we can use the luminosity of White-Dwarf supernovae to calibrate their average luminosity.
  - We can then calibrate Hubble's law by determining the Hubble constant, which will enable us to determine a galaxy's distance from its redshift.

- **3) List at least three qualities that would tend to make a type of astronomical object useful as a standard candle.**
  - Fixed brightness or a periodic change in brightness that isn't irregular, relative commonness (nothing super rare), standard luminosity that can correlate with other phenomena.

- **4) Explain why we observe distant galaxies to be moving away from us and therefore believe that the universe is expanding, but we don't see individual galaxies or clusters expanding.**
  - Galaxy clusters stay together due to gravity. The pull of gravity slows the expansion rate of the universe. In particularly dense regions, gravity is able to overcome the expansion and inhibit the expansion of these objects. Where the average density is lower, gravity doesn't have as strong of an effect, and so the expansion continues between galaxy clusters.

- **5) Briefly explain why we think white-dwarf supernovae are useful for measuring cosmic distances.**
  - White dwarf supernovae are useful for measuring cosmic distances because they all occur when the mass of the white dwarf exceeds the Chandrasekhar Limit, $1.4M_{sun}$. This provides a standardized luminosity from which we can use the supernovae's apparent brightness to determine distance from the luminosity-distance formula.

- **6) How does the age of the universe depend on Hubble's constant, and why?**
  - The larger $H_{0}$ is, the younger the universe. This is because, for larger $H_{0}$, $\vec{v}$ is also larger by Hubble's Law, which means it took less time to reach its current size.

- **7) Recall that Hubble's law is written $v = H_{0}d$, where v is the recession velocity of a galaxy located a distance d away from us, and $H_{0}$ is Hubble's constant. Suppose $H_{0} = 55$ km/s/Mpc. How fast would a galaxy located 500 megaparsecs distant be receding from us? Show all work clearly, and state your final answer with a complete sentence. Give the speed in units of kilometers per second and as a percentage of the speed of light.**
  - Recall Hubble's Law: $\vec{v} = H_{0}d = 55 \dfrac{km/s}{Mpc} \cdot 500 Mpc = 27,500 km/s$
  - Recall that the speed of light is 300,000km/s
  - \therefore $27,500 = 300,000x \implies \vec{v} = 0.09c$

- **8) Describe how scientists measure the distances to galaxies, starting with how they measure the distances of the nearest stars. Be sure to include enough detail so that someone who does not know the jargon of astronomy can still understand your explanation.**
  - We use parallax for nearby distances and standard candles for farther distances.

### **21 Free-Response Questions**
- **1) Give examples demonstrating the role of "nature" and "nurture" in galaxy evolution.**
  - All galaxies form from a similar process, but the conditions of the protogalactic clouds they form from, as well as the interactions the galaxy has with other galaxies (e.g. collisions) may affect the formation of the galaxy. Differences in initial conditions of protogalactic clouds, such as their angular momentum, can result in a different galaxy formation. Low angular momentum might form a spheroidal or elliptical galaxy. High angular momentum might result the cloud collapsing into a disk and forming into a spiral galaxy. A collision between galaxies may result in an elliptical galaxy

- **2) Briefly explain why starburst galaxies appear fairly ordinary when they are observed in visible light but extraordinary when they are observed in infrared light.**
  - Starburst galaxies are galaxies that undergo exceptionally high rates of star formation, in comparison to the long-term average rate of star formation in the galaxy. They can occur in disk and irregular galaxies. A specific kind of starburst galaxy (and probably the kind this question is referring to) is the Luminous Infrared Galaxy (LIRG). These include Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) and Hyperluminous Infrared Galaxies (HLIRGs). ULIRGs are extremely dusty. UV radiation produced by the star formation obscured by the dust is absorbed by the dust and re-radiated in the infrared spectrum, producing the extreme red colors of LIRGs.

- **3) Explain why galaxy interactions are far more common than star-star interactions.**
  - Galaxy interactions are far more common than star-star interactions because the density of galaxy clusters is far larger proportionally to the density of star clusters.

- **4) Why do spiral galaxy mergers often trigger starbursts?**
  - Spiral galaxy mergers/collisions often trigger starbursts because spiral galaxies, which are rich with dust, cause the dust clouds to migrate to a common point, triggering bursts of star formation (stars are born from these dense dust clouds). 

- **5) How does a starburst end? What might happen to the galaxy afterwards?**
  - Starbursts may end after all the available gas is used up. They may also end through the combined effect of multiple supernovae forming a superbubble, blowing all the gas out of the galaxy. The galaxy may then age, as old stars will still be alive, dying off eventually with no new star formation occurring until enough gas accumulates again.

- **6) Give several observations supporting the idea that the high redshifts of quasars really do imply great distances.**
  - We see quasars with high redshifts, but none with blueshifts.
  - Images show quasars are embedded in distant galaxies.
  - Some quasars have been observed to be members of distant galaxy clusters.
  - We see absorption lines produced by intergalactic gas between the quasar and us.
  - We have observed a progression of other active galaxies, with those farther away being more active and closer ones being less active.

- **7) How are the jets produced by radio galaxies similar to those from protostars?**
  - Jets in radio galaxies and in protostars form from the same/similar physical mechanisms, as means for these systems to shed their angular momentum. Jets produced by radio galaxies and protostars also coexist with the disks surrounding protostars and black holes in these respective systems.

- **8) How do jets produced by radio galaxies differ from those of protostars?**
  - Jets in radio galaxies are different from jets in protostars in their size and energy output. Additionally, the centers of radio galaxies are supermassive black holes, while protostellar disks orbit actual protostars with surfaces.

- **9) Briefly explain how we think quasars produce so much energy.**
  - We think quasars produce so much energy because this energy is theorized to be produced in the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. As the material in the accretion disk approaches the event horizon, it accelerates and accelerates, approaching (but never breaching) the speed of light. 

- **10) What information about protogalactic gas clouds is contained in quasar absorption lines?**
  - Quasar absorption lines show the presence of clouds between our point of view and the quasar. These absorption lines indicate the presence of hydrogen absorption in nearer, older galaxies as well as heavier elements in the distant younger objects.
