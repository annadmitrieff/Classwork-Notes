### **S2 Free-Response Questions**

- **1) Suppose a supersonic airplane flies at a speed of 1,650 km/hr from Nairobi, Kenya, to Quito, Ecuador; note that this is the same speed that Earth rotates, but in the opposite direction. Describe how this flight would look to an observer on the Moon.**
  - The airplane would appear to lift off the ground and stand still while the Earth rotates beneath it.

- **2) Describe at least three pieces of evidence supporting the special theory of relativity.**
  - Hafele & Keating's atomic clocks.
  - $\pi ^+$ mesons' lifespans at high velocities in particle accelerators.
  - Validations of $E = mc^2$ (nuclear bombs, etc).

- **3a) Recall that a π+ meson produced at rest has a lifetime of 18 billionths of a second. Thus, in its own reference frame, a π+ meson will always "think" it is at rest and therefore decay after 18 billionths of a second (1.8 × 10-8 s). Suppose a π+ meson is produced in a particle accelerator traveling at 0.998c. According to scientists in the lab, how long will the π+ meson last compared to its normal lifetime of 18 billionths of a second (e.g., shorter, the same, or longer)?**
  - In the lab's reference frame, time will appear slowed for the $\pi ^ +$ meson and thus its lifetime will seem longer.

- **3b) Recall that the time dilation formula is: $$t = \dfrac{t'}{\sqrt{1 - (\dfrac{v}{c})^2}}$$ where *t* is the time in the laboratory and *t'* is the time for the moving particle. Use the time dilation formula to calculate how long scientists will see the $\pi ^{+}$ meson last before it decays.**
  - $$t = \dfrac{1.8 \times 10^{-8}}{\sqrt{1 - (0.998)^2}} \approx 2.847 \times 10^{-7}s$$

-  **4) Suppose you stay home on Earth while your twin sister takes a trip to a distant star and back in a spaceship that travels at 99 percent of the speed of light. If both of you are 25 years old when she leaves and you are 45 years old when she returns, how old is your sister when she gets back?**
  - Recall the time dilation formula: $$t' = t\sqrt{1-(\dfrac{v}{c})^2}$$
  - We compute: $$t' = 20 \sqrt{1 - (0.99)^2} \approx 2.8yrs$$

-  **5) A clever student decides to spend time cruising around the local solar neighborhood at a speed of 0.95c (95 percent of the speed of light). How much time will pass on her spacecraft during a period in which 70 years pass on Earth?**
  - Recall the time dilation formula: $$t' = t \sqrt{1 - (\dfrac{v}{c})^2} = 70 \sqrt{1 - (0.95)^2} = 21.8 yrs$$

-  **6) Julia is traveling away from you at 0.95c when she shoots a probe forward from her spacecraft. According to her, the probe travels at 0.8c. How fast do you see the probe going?**
  - Recall the formula: $$v_{combined} = \dfrac{v_{1}+v_{2}}{1 + v_{1} \times{v^2}{c^2}} = \dfrac{}{}$$
