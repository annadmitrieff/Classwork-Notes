### **18 Multiple-Choice Questions**

- **1) Degeneracy pressure is the source of the pressure that stops the crush of gravity in all the
following *except*:**
  - A) a brown dwarf.
  - B) a white dwarf.
  - C) a neutron star.
  - D) a very massive main-sequence star.
  - E) the central core of the sun after hydrogen fusion ceases but before helium fusion begins.
$${\color{orange}\text{D: A very massive main-sequence star is kept from collapsing by nuclear fusion. Through the fusion of hydrogen into helium in their cores, the radiation and heat from this reaction keep the force of gravity from collapsing the star.}}$$

- **2) White dwarfs are so called because:**
  - A) they are both very hot and very small.
  - B) they are the end-products of small, low-mass stars.
  - C) they are the opposite of black holes.
  - D) it amplifies the contrast with red giants.
  - E) they are supported by electron degeneracy pressure.
$${\color{orange}\text{A: White dwarfs are what become of main sequence stars once they have exhausted their nuclear fuel: only their very hot, very small core remains, held together by gravity and kept from collapsing by electron degeneracy pressure. They are the end-products of normal main-sequence stars: C,D, and E are obviously wrong and/or irrelevant.}}$$

- **3) A teaspoonful of white dwarf material on Earth would weigh:**
  - A) the same as a teaspoonful of Earth-like material.
  - B) about the same as Mt. Everest.
  - C) about the same as the Earth.
  - D) a few tons.
  - E) a few million tons.
$${\color{orange}\text{D: Recall from the lecture: something about a Ford F-150 being crushed into a sugar cube? A is clearly wrong, B is too much, C is definitely too much, and E is also definitely too much.}}$$

- **4) Which of the following is closest in mass to a white dwarf?**
  - A) the Moon
  - B) the Earth
  - C) Jupiter
  - D) Neptune
  - E) the Sun
  $${\color{orange}\text{E: White dwarfs are formed when main sequence stars run out of fuel. It is most logical that they're closest in mass to a main-sequence star, which the Sun is.}}$$

- **5) Why is there an upper limit to the mass of a white dwarf?**
  - A) White dwarfs come only from stars smaller than 1.4 solar masses.
  - B) The more massive the white dwarf, the greater the degeneracy pressure and the faster the speeds of its electrons. Near 1.4 solar masses, the speeds of the electrons approach the speed of light, so more mass cannot be added without breaking the degeneracy pressure.
  - C) The more massive the white dwarf, the higher its temperature and hence the greater its degeneracy pressure. At about 1.4 solar masses, the temperature becomes so high that all matter effectively melts, even individual subatomic particles.
  - D) The upper limit to the masses of white dwarfs was determined through observations of white dwarfs, but no one knows why the limit exists.
  - E) Above this mass, the electrons would be pushed together so closely they would turn into neutrons and the star would become a neutron star.
 $${\color{orange}\text{B: This question is about the Chandrasekhar Limit } (M_{white \ dwarf} = 1.4M_{sun}). \text{ B is just the correct explanation here, though you could probably logically infer it by deducing that the most impossible event in each of these answers are particles with velocities exceeding c.}}$$

- **6) What is the ultimate fate of an isolated white dwarf?**
  - A) It will cool down and become a cold black dwarf.
  - B) As gravity overwhelms the electron degeneracy pressure, it will explode as a nova.
  - C) As gravity overwhelms the electron degeneracy pressure, it will explode as a supernova.
  - D) As gravity overwhelms the electron degeneracy pressure, it will become a neutron star.
  - E) The electron degeneracy pressure will eventually overwhelm gravity and the white dwarf will slowly evaporate.
$${\color{orange}\text{A: All white dwarf novae occur in binary systems. Neutron stars are formed from massive, giant stars running out of fuel. White dwarfs don't just evaporate.}}$$

- **7) Suppose a white dwarf is gaining mass because of accretion in a binary system. What happens if the mass someday reaches the 1.4-solar-mass limit?**
  - A) The white dwarf undergoes a catastrophic collapse, leading to a type of supernova that is somewhat different from that which occurs in a massive star but is comparable in energy.
  - B) The white dwarf, which is made mostly of carbon, suddenly becomes much hotter in temperature and therefore is able to begin fusing the carbon. This turns the white dwarf back into a star supported against gravity by ordinary pressure.
  - C) The white dwarf immediately collapses into a black hole, disappearing from view.
  - D) A white dwarf can never gain enough mass to reach the limit because a strong stellar wind prevents the material from reaching it in the first place.
$${\color{orange}\text{A: We can rule out C and D simply because they're flat-out wrong. We can rule out B because, by principle, nuclear fusion does not take place in White Dwarfs.}}$$

- **8) Which of the following statements about novae is *not* true?**
  - A) A star system that undergoes a nova may have another nova sometime in the future.
  - B) A nova involves fusion taking place on the surface of a white dwarf.
  - C) Our Sun will probably undergo at least one nova when it becomes a white dwarf about 5 billion years from now.
  - D) When a star system undergoes a nova, it brightens considerably, but not as much as a star system undergoing a supernova.
  - E) The word nova means "new star" and originally referred to stars that suddenly appeared in the sky, then disappeared again after a few weeks or months.
$${\color{orange}\text{C: The sun is not in a binary star system, so a nova will not occur.}}$$

- **9) What kind of pressure supports a white dwarf?**
  - A) neutron degeneracy pressure
  - B) electron degeneracy pressure
  - C) thermal pressure
  - D) radiation pressure
  - E) all of the above
$${\color{orange}\text{B: neutron degeneracy pressure occurs with neutron stars, thermal and radiative pressure occur in stars.}}$$

- **10) What is the upper limit to the mass of a white dwarf?**
  - A) There is no upper limit.
  - B) There is an upper limit, but we don't know what it is.
  - C) 2$M_{sun}$
  - D) 1.4$M_{sun}$
  - E) 1$M_{sun}$
$${\color{orange}\text{D: The Chandrasekhar Limit is } 1.4M_{sun}.}$$

- **11) How does a 1.2-solar-mass white dwarf compare to a 1.0-solar-mass white dwarf?** 
  - A) It has a larger radius.
  - B) It has a smaller radius.
  - C) It has a higher surface temperature.
  - D) It has a lower surface temperature.
  - E) It is supported by neutron, rather than electron, degeneracy pressure.
$${\color{orange}\text{B: More mass means that the } F_g \text{ holding the White Dwarf together is greater, which means more inward pressure and thus a smaller radius.}}$$

- **12) Which of the following is closest in size (radius) to a white dwarf?**
  - A) Earth
  - B) A small city
  - C) A football stadium
  - D) A basketball
  - E) The Sun.
$${\color{orange}\text{A: B is for Neutron Stars. C is just too small for anything, as is D. E is incorrect as White Dwarfs are the dead cores of main sequence stars (e.g. the Sun), so they must be considerably smaller than main sequence stars (e.g. the Sun).}}$$

- **13) What kind of star is most likely to become a white dwarf Supernova?**
  - A) An O star
  - B) A star like our Sun.
  - C) A binary M star.
  - D) A white dwarf star with a red giant binary companion.
  - E) A pulsar.
$${\color{orange}\text{D: O-stars are too large to typically become White Dwarfs. While main sequence stars like the Sun usually become White Dwarfs, a binary system is needed for a supernova to happen. An M star is a main sequence star, but D is an even more likely binary system. Pulsars are neutron stars.}}$$

- **14) Observationally, how can we tell the difference between a white-dwarf supernova and a massive-star supernova?**
  - A) A massive-star supernova is brighter than a white-dwarf supernova.
  - B) A massive-star supernova happens only once, while a white-dwarf supernova can repeat periodically.
  - C) The spectrum of a massive-star supernova shows prominent hydrogen lines, while the spectrum of a white-dwarf supernova does not.
  - D) The light of a white-dwarf supernova fades steadily, while the light of a massive-star supernova brightens for many weeks.
  - E) We cannot yet tell the difference between a massive-star supernova and a white-dwarf supernova.
$${\color{orange}\text{C: Massive star supernovae show hydrogen lines because they still have a supply of hydrogen fuel. White dwarfs don't have any hydrogen emission lines because they have no hydrogen.}}$$

- **15) After a massive-star supernova, what is left behind?**
  - A) Always a white dwarf.
  - B) Always a neutron star.
  - C) Always a black hole.
  - D) Either a white dwarf or a neutron star.
  - E) Either a neutron star or a black hole.
$${\color{orange}\text{E: Omit all "always" statements in general because science doesn't usually work like that. D doesn't hold because White Dwarfs form when main sequence stars run out of fuel.}}$$

- **16) A teaspoonful of neutron star material on Earth would weigh:**
  - A) about the same as a teaspoonful of Earth-like material.
  - B) a few tons.
  - C) more than Mt. Everest.
  - D) more than the Moon.
  - E) more than Earth.
$${\color{orange}\text{C: Definitely not A, definitely more than B, but definitely less than D and E. C is our happy medium.}}$$

- **17) Which of the following is closest in size (radius) to a neutron star?**
  - A) Earth
  - B) A city
  - C) A football stadium
  - D) A basketball
  - E) The Sun.
$${\color{orange}\text{B: Remember from lecture; about the size of Athens?}}$$

- **18) Which of the following best describes what would happen if a 1.5-solar-mass neutron star, with a diameter of a few kilometers, were suddenly (for unexplained reasons) to appear in your hometown?**
  - A) The entire mass of Earth would end up as a thin layer, about 1 cm thick, over the surface of the neutron star.
  - B) It would rapidly sink to the center of Earth.
  - C) The combined mass of Earth and the neutron star would cause the neutron star to collapse into a black hole.
  - D) It would crash through Earth, creating a large crater, and exit Earth on the other side.
  - E) E) It would crash into Earth, throwing vast amounts of dust into the atmosphere which in turn would cool Earth. Such a scenario is probably what caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.
$${\color{orange}\text{A: We rule out D and E, or any scenario that leaves the Earth intact. B implies the force of the Earth's gravity is greater than that of the neutron star. The mass of the Earth is probably negligible enough for a black hole to not be an option here. A is the most likely answer.}}$$

- **19) From an observational standpoint, what is a *pulsar*?**
  - A) a star that slowly changes its brightness, getting dimmer and then brighter with a period of anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks
  - B) an object that emits flashes of light several times per second or more, with near perfect regularity
  - C) an object that emits random "pulses" of light that sometimes occur only a fraction of a second apart and other times stop for several days at a time
  - D) a star that changes color rapidly, from blue to red and back again
  - E) a star that rapidly changes size as it moves off the main sequence
$${\color{orange}\text{B: We rule out D and E because they're just incorrect. C doesn't hold because pulsars flash regularly. A doesn't hold because pulsars flash very quickly.}}$$

- **20) From a theoretical standpoint, what is a pulsar?**
  - A) a star that alternately expands and contracts in size
  - B) a rapidly rotating neutron star
  - C) a neutron star or black hole that happens to be in a binary system
  - D) a binary system that happens to be aligned so that one star periodically eclipses the other
  - E) a star that is burning iron in its core
$${\color{orange}\text{B: A describes Cepheid Variable Stars. C is something possible, but not what a pulsar is. D just describes a binary system. E is just not true.}}$$

- **21) What causes the radio pulses of a pulsar?**
  - A) The star vibrates.
  - B) As the star spins, beams of radio radiation sweep through space. If one of the beams crosses Earth, we observe a pulse.
  - C) The star undergoes periodic explosions of nuclear fusion that generate radio emission.
  - D) The star's orbiting companion periodically eclipses the radio waves by the main pulsar.
  - E) A black hole near the star absorbs energy and re-emits it as radio waves.
$${\color{orange}\text{B: Most probable answer as pulsars' key 'feature' is their sweeping rotation.}}$$
