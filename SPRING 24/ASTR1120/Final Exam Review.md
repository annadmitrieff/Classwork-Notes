### **S2 Multiple-Choice Questions**

- **1) Each of the following lists two statements. Which two are the basic premises for the special theory of relativity?**
  - A) The laws of nature are the same for everyone. The speed of light is the same for everyone.
  - B) Everything is relative. You can never really tell who is moving.
  - C) You can't go faster than the speed of light. Time is different for different people.
  - D) The laws of nature are the same for everyone. Everything is relative.
  - E) The speed of light is the same for everyone. You can't go faster than the speed of light.
$${\color{magenta}\text{A: The tenets of special relativity is that the speed of light is constant in every reference frame (inertial or not) and that the laws of physics are invariant in all inertial reference frames.}}$$

- **2) Which of the following statements best describes what is "relative" in the theory of relativity?**
  - A) The theory says that everything is relative.
  - B) The theory says that truth can never be established in any absolute sense.

  - E) The theory says that all scientific results must be considered within the context of the scientists' individual viewpoints.
$${\color{magenta}\text{C: Not everything is relative (see: speed of light). B is a bit of a generalization--you just need to identify a reference frame. D just isn't true. E is true, I guess, but too specific for the general idea of this theory.}}$$

- **3) Which of the following is *not* a prediction made by the theory of relativity?**
  - A) No material object sent outward from Earth can reach or exceed the speed of light.

  - E) He sees you moving toward him at 85 km/hr and the ball moving toward him at 75 km/hr.
$${\color{magenta}\text{D: Relative velocity tells us that Al is stationary with respect to his reference frame, but that we're moving away with a velocity of -85km/hr. The ball's relative velocity is 85 - 75km/hr = 10km/hr.}}$$

$${\color{magenta}\text{E: In general we can infer that the baseball will be moving with a velocity of 120 - 100km. To Shawn, we are moving away at 120km/hr. The baseball is moving away at 100km/hr. Therefore, to us, Shawn is moving away at 120km/hr and the baseball is moving away at 120-100km/hr.}}$$

- **9) Sue is traveling toward you at 90 km/hr. She throws a baseball that, according to her, is going at 90 km/hr in the opposite direction. What do you see the ball doing?**

  - A) They will know you are going very fast but will have no way of knowing whether you ever exceed the speed of light.
  - B) You will see any beam of light from Earth coming toward you at the speed of light, which means it will catch you. Thus, the people on Earth must conclude that you are going slower than the speed of light.
  - C) An imaginary spaceship can go as fast as it wants, so the folks on Earth soon will see you going faster than the speed of light.
  - D) You may soon be racing away from Earth faster than the speed of light, but, if so, people on Earth will no longer be able to see you.
  - E) Without more information, it is impossible to know how fast you would see a light beam from Earth coming toward you. If it happens that you are going fast enough so that the light can't catch you, then people on Earth would find you to be going faster than light.
$${\color{magenta}\text{B: We can't exceed the speed of light. That rules out A, C, D, and E.}}$$

$${\color{magenta}\text{D: When travelling at the speed of light, a unit of time/distance relative to our average velocities (zero, compared to the speed of light) will be quite a bit less.}}$$

- **15) How would we view time (clocks) on the spaceship in the situation above as it goes by?**

  - B) Their clocks are going at the same rate as ours.
  - C) Their clocks are going exactly half as fast as ours.
  - D) Their clocks are going faster than ours.
  - E) Their clocks are going slower than ours.
$${\color{magenta}\text{E: The science-y explanation for this tends to confuse me, so I like to think of Interstellar instead. Remember: Murph aged whereas Cooper didn't. Time moved slower for him.}}$$

  - A) Its mass is infinite.
  - B) Its mass is greater than its rest mass.
  - C) Its mass is the same as it would be if it were not moving.

  - B) Our clocks are going fast.
  - C) Our clocks are going slow.

  - A) About a month.
  - B) About 10 years.
  - C) About 25 years.
  - D) About 100 years.
  - E) About 1,000 years.
$${\color{magenta}\text{C: 1 lightyear is the distance light travels in 1 year. If you're travelling at ~c, you'll functionally use the same unit.}}$$

- **20) Which of the following best describes the situation according to Jackie?**
  - A) She stays still, while Earth rushes away from her at 0.9999c and Vega rushes toward her at 0.9999c. Since Vega is 25 light-years away, she says it takes Vega about 25 years to reach her.
  - B) She stays still, while Earth rushes away from her at 0.9999c and Vega rushes toward her at 0.9999c. She sees the distance from Earth to Vega shortened considerably from 25 light-years, and therefore it takes far less than 25 years for Vega to reach her.
  - C) She says that the 25-light-year trip takes only a few months and therefore concludes that she is traveling faster than the speed of light.
  - D) She's taking a trip that takes 25 years from Earth to Vega.
$${\color{magenta}\text{B: We can rule out C and D because the idea of Earth moving away is correct. However, because she is moving at the speed of light and due to time dilation, without even knowing the science, we can infer that it won't take her (in her reference frame) the same amount of time for her trip in our reference frame.}}$$

- **21) Which of the following correctly describes the situation when Jackie returns to Earth? (Ages in this problem refer to biological ages–that is, how much time has passed for each sister since she was born.)**
  - A) It's the year 2050, and both twin sisters are 70 years old.
  - B) It's the year 2050. Gwen (who stayed home) is 70 years old, but Jackie is only a little older than her age of 20 when she left.
  - C) It's the year 2050. Gwen is 70 years old. Jackie is 19.
  - D) It's the year 2100. Gwen and Jackie are both 120 years old.
  - E) According to Gwen, Jackie returns to Earth in the year 2050, but according to Jackie, she returns in the year 2001.
$${\color{magenta}\text{B: Gwen is 20 + 25 + 25 years old (25 years for each direction of Jackie's trip). Jackie is only a little older.}}$$

- **22) Ben is racing a light beam in a 100-meter dash. Ben bursts out of the starting blocks at 99 percent of the speed of light (0.99c). At the same instant, a flashlight beam is turned on from the starting blocks. According to the spectators watching in the stands, what happens?**
  - A) The light beam wins the race, but barely–it is going 1 percent of the speed of light faster than Ben.
  - B) The light beam instantly finishes the race, before Ben even has a chance to start.
  - C) The light beam wins the race by a large margin because it is going faster than Ben by the full speed of light.
  - D) Ben beats the light beam to the finish line, becoming a hero.
$${\color{magenta}\text{A: We can rule out D. To Ben, the light \textit{is} moving at c relative to him, but we care about the spectators here. Relative to them, Ben is moving c - 0.99c m/s slower than the light beam.}}$$

- **23) Referring to the race above, what happens according to Ben?**
  - A) The light beam gradually pulls ahead of him and wins the race because it is going 1 percent of the speed of light faster than him.
  - B) The light beam instantly finishes the race, before Ben even has a chance to start.
  - C) The light beam moves out ahead of him at the full speed of light, winning the race easily.

  - C) The bomb shortens the lifetimes of all people who happen to be near it when it detonates.
  - D) The bomb produces energy in accord with $E = mc^2$, which is part of the theory of relativity.
$${\color{magenta}\text{D: A bit of a 'gotcha' question? A might work if there were enough force. B and C are just not true, I think? D is correct, but seems a bit obvious since that's a rule attached to anything involving energy and mass nonspecific to a bomb.}}$$

- **25) The lifetime of a $\pi^+$ meson normally is 18 nanoseconds. In a large particle accelerator,
scientists can create $\pi^+$ mesons moving at speeds very close to the speed of light. What do the

  - B) The $\pi^+$ meson lasts much more than 18 nanoseconds.
  - C) The $\pi^+$ meson lasts much less than 18 nanoseconds.
  - D) The $\pi^+$ meson no longer decays and remains a stable particle.
$${\color{magenta}\text{B: Time moves slower for objects moving closer to c. Thus, the mesons will age slower (to our POV).}}$$

- **26) You take a trip to a star located 1,000 light-years away and return. You travel at an average
speed of 0.99c. About how long will the trip take, according to you?* HINT: Recall the time dilation formula:***

  - A) 2.8 years
  - B) 10 years
  - C) 28 years
  - D) 280 years
  - E) 2,000 years
$${\color{magenta}\text{D: Given c = 1.0, v = 0.99c, distance = 1000 lightyears one way, the travel time in the stationary frame is }\dfrac{2 \cdot distance}{velocity}. \text{ We thus compute }t' = ^{t_{stationary}} \sqrt{1 - (0.99)^2} \approx 284}$$

  - A) 2.8 years
  - B) 10 years
  - C) 28 years
  - D) 2,000 years
  - E) 280 years
$${\color{magenta}\text{D: 1 lightyear is how far light travels in 1 year. To us, it will take the full 2,000 years for light to travel 2,000 lightyears.}}$$

  - A) vertical.
  - B) horizontal.
  - C) slanted.
  - D) curved.
  - E) a circle.

  - D) any time you are very far from any planet
  - E) You can never be truly weightless.
$${\color{blue}\text{C: Weightlessness is associated with either floating freely sans-gravity or freefall with gravity. If your worldline is following the straightest possible path through spacetime, it means you are in freefall.}}$$

  - A) flat geometry
  - B) spherical geometry
  - C) saddle-shaped geometry
  - D) Euclidean geometry
  - E) This situation can never occur.
$${\color{blue}\text{B: We can infer that the surface must be curved. With hyperbolic geometry, parallel lines curve away from each-other. Saddle-shaped introduces both concave and convex curves, so it's not definitive. Spherical is the right answer here. }}$$

$${\color{blue}\text{E: Think of it as time trying to progress but struggling to resist the stationary pull of gravity.}}$$

- **18) Why do we see a gravitational redshift in the spectrum of the Sun?**
  - A) Gravity makes light heavy, causing it to appear redder.
  - B) Because of gravity, the Sun is always moving away from us, so we see a redshift.
  - C) Time runs slower on the Sun than on Earth, making lines in the solar spectrum have lower frequency and hence longer wavelength than normal.
  - D) Spacetime curvature allows red photons of light to escape the Sun more easily than blue photons, leading to an apparent redshift.
$${\color{blue}\text{C: A stronger force of gravity causes light's wavelength to lengthen because time slows.}}$$

### **18 Multiple-Choice Questions**

- **1) Degeneracy pressure is the source of the pressure that stops the crush of gravity in all the
following *except*:**
  - A) a brown dwarf.
  - B) a white dwarf.
  - C) a neutron star.
  - D) a very massive main-sequence star.
  - E) the central core of the sun after hydrogen fusion ceases but before helium fusion begins.
$${\color{orange}\text{D: A very massive main-sequence star is kept from collapsing by nuclear fusion. Through the fusion of hydrogen into helium in their cores, the radiation and heat from this reaction keep the force of gravity from collapsing the star.}}$$

- **2) White dwarfs are so called because:**
  - A) they are both very hot and very small.
  - B) they are the end-products of small, low-mass stars.
  - C) they are the opposite of black holes.
  - D) it amplifies the contrast with red giants.
  - E) they are supported by electron degeneracy pressure.
$${\color{orange}\text{A: White dwarfs are what become of main sequence stars once they have exhausted their nuclear fuel: only their very hot, very small core remains, held together by gravity and kept from collapsing by electron degeneracy pressure. They are the end-products of normal main-sequence stars: C,D, and E are obviously wrong and/or irrelevant.}}$$

- **3) A teaspoonful of white dwarf material on Earth would weigh:**
  - A) the same as a teaspoonful of Earth-like material.
  - B) about the same as Mt. Everest.
  - C) about the same as the Earth.
  - D) a few tons.
  - E) a few million tons.
$${\color{orange}\text{D: Recall from the lecture: something about a Ford F-150 being crushed into a sugar cube? A is clearly wrong, B is too much, C is definitely too much, and E is also definitely too much.}}$$

- **4) Which of the following is closest in mass to a white dwarf?**
  - A) the Moon
  - B) the Earth
  - C) Jupiter
  - D) Neptune
  - E) the Sun
  $${\color{orange}\text{E: White dwarfs are formed when main sequence stars run out of fuel. It is most logical that they're closest in mass to a main-sequence star, which the Sun is.}}$$

- **5) Why is there an upper limit to the mass of a white dwarf?**
  - A) White dwarfs come only from stars smaller than 1.4 solar masses.
  - B) The more massive the white dwarf, the greater the degeneracy pressure and the faster the speeds of its electrons. Near 1.4 solar masses, the speeds of the electrons approach the speed of light, so more mass cannot be added without breaking the degeneracy pressure.
  - C) The more massive the white dwarf, the higher its temperature and hence the greater its degeneracy pressure. At about 1.4 solar masses, the temperature becomes so high that all matter effectively melts, even individual subatomic particles.
  - D) The upper limit to the masses of white dwarfs was determined through observations of white dwarfs, but no one knows why the limit exists.
  - E) Above this mass, the electrons would be pushed together so closely they would turn into neutrons and the star would become a neutron star.
 $${\color{orange}\text{B: This question is about the Chandrasekhar Limit } (M_{white \ dwarf} = 1.4M_{sun}). \text{ B is just the correct explanation here, though you could probably logically infer it by deducing that the most impossible event in each of these answers are particles with velocities exceeding c.}}$$

- **6) What is the ultimate fate of an isolated white dwarf?**
  - A) It will cool down and become a cold black dwarf.
  - B) As gravity overwhelms the electron degeneracy pressure, it will explode as a nova.
  - C) As gravity overwhelms the electron degeneracy pressure, it will explode as a supernova.
  - D) As gravity overwhelms the electron degeneracy pressure, it will become a neutron star.
  - E) The electron degeneracy pressure will eventually overwhelm gravity and the white dwarf will slowly evaporate.
$${\color{orange}\text{A: All white dwarf novae occur in binary systems. Neutron stars are formed from massive, giant stars running out of fuel. White dwarfs don't just evaporate.}}$$

- **7) Suppose a white dwarf is gaining mass because of accretion in a binary system. What happens if the mass someday reaches the 1.4-solar-mass limit?**
  - A) The white dwarf undergoes a catastrophic collapse, leading to a type of supernova that is somewhat different from that which occurs in a massive star but is comparable in energy.
  - B) The white dwarf, which is made mostly of carbon, suddenly becomes much hotter in temperature and therefore is able to begin fusing the carbon. This turns the white dwarf back into a star supported against gravity by ordinary pressure.
  - C) The white dwarf immediately collapses into a black hole, disappearing from view.
  - D) A white dwarf can never gain enough mass to reach the limit because a strong stellar wind prevents the material from reaching it in the first place.
$${\color{orange}\text{A: We can rule out C and D simply because they're flat-out wrong. We can rule out B because, by principle, nuclear fusion does not take place in White Dwarfs.}}$$

- **8) Which of the following statements about novae is *not* true?**
  - A) A star system that undergoes a nova may have another nova sometime in the future.
  - B) A nova involves fusion taking place on the surface of a white dwarf.
  - C) Our Sun will probably undergo at least one nova when it becomes a white dwarf about 5 billion years from now.
  - D) When a star system undergoes a nova, it brightens considerably, but not as much as a star system undergoing a supernova.
  - E) The word nova means "new star" and originally referred to stars that suddenly appeared in the sky, then disappeared again after a few weeks or months.
$${\color{orange}\text{C: The sun is not in a binary star system, so a nova will not occur.}}$$

- **9) What kind of pressure supports a white dwarf?**
  - A) neutron degeneracy pressure
  - B) electron degeneracy pressure
  - C) thermal pressure
  - D) radiation pressure
  - E) all of the above
$${\color{orange}\text{B: neutron degeneracy pressure occurs with neutron stars, thermal and radiative pressure occur in stars.}}$$

- **10) What is the upper limit to the mass of a white dwarf?**
  - A) There is no upper limit.
  - B) There is an upper limit, but we don't know what it is.
  - C) 2$M_{sun}$
  - D) 1.4$M_{sun}$
  - E) 1$M_{sun}$
$${\color{orange}\text{D: The Chandrasekhar Limit is } 1.4M_{sun}.}$$

- **11) How does a 1.2-solar-mass white dwarf compare to a 1.0-solar-mass white dwarf?** 
  - A) It has a larger radius.
  - B) It has a smaller radius.
  - C) It has a higher surface temperature.
  - D) It has a lower surface temperature.
  - E) It is supported by neutron, rather than electron, degeneracy pressure.
$${\color{orange}\text{B: More mass means that the } F_g \text{ holding the White Dwarf together is greater, which means more inward pressure and thus a smaller radius.}}$$

- **12) Which of the following is closest in size (radius) to a white dwarf?**
  - A) Earth
  - B) A small city
  - C) A football stadium
  - D) A basketball
  - E) The Sun.
$${\color{orange}\text{A: B is for Neutron Stars. C is just too small for anything, as is D. E is incorrect as White Dwarfs are the dead cores of main sequence stars (e.g. the Sun), so they must be considerably smaller than main sequence stars (e.g. the Sun).}}$$

- **13) What kind of star is most likely to become a white dwarf Supernova?**
  - A) An O star
  - B) A star like our Sun.
  - C) A binary M star.
  - D) A white dwarf star with a red giant binary companion.
  - E) A pulsar.
$${\color{orange}\text{D: O-stars are too large to typically become White Dwarfs. While main sequence stars like the Sun usually become White Dwarfs, a binary system is needed for a supernova to happen. An M star is a main sequence star, but D is an even more likely binary system. Pulsars are neutron stars.}}$$

- **14) Observationally, how can we tell the difference between a white-dwarf supernova and a massive-star supernova?**
  - A) A massive-star supernova is brighter than a white-dwarf supernova.
  - B) A massive-star supernova happens only once, while a white-dwarf supernova can repeat periodically.
  - C) The spectrum of a massive-star supernova shows prominent hydrogen lines, while the spectrum of a white-dwarf supernova does not.
  - D) The light of a white-dwarf supernova fades steadily, while the light of a massive-star supernova brightens for many weeks.
  - E) We cannot yet tell the difference between a massive-star supernova and a white-dwarf supernova.
$${\color{orange}\text{C: Massive star supernovae show hydrogen lines because they still have a supply of hydrogen fuel. White dwarfs don't have any hydrogen emission lines because they have no hydrogen.}}$$

- **15) After a massive-star supernova, what is left behind?**
  - A) Always a white dwarf.
  - B) Always a neutron star.
  - C) Always a black hole.
  - D) Either a white dwarf or a neutron star.
  - E) Either a neutron star or a black hole.
$${\color{orange}\text{E: Omit all "always" statements in general because science doesn't usually work like that. D doesn't hold because White Dwarfs form when main sequence stars run out of fuel.}}$$

- **16) A teaspoonful of neutron star material on Earth would weigh:**
  - A) about the same as a teaspoonful of Earth-like material.
  - B) a few tons.
  - C) more than Mt. Everest.
  - D) more than the Moon.
  - E) more than Earth.
$${\color{orange}\text{C: Definitely not A, definitely more than B, but definitely less than D and E. C is our happy medium.}}$$

- **17) Which of the following is closest in size (radius) to a neutron star?**
  - A) Earth
  - B) A city
  - C) A football stadium
  - D) A basketball
  - E) The Sun.
$${\color{orange}\text{B: Remember from lecture; about the size of Athens?}}$$

- **18) Which of the following best describes what would happen if a 1.5-solar-mass neutron star, with a diameter of a few kilometers, were suddenly (for unexplained reasons) to appear in your hometown?**
  - A) The entire mass of Earth would end up as a thin layer, about 1 cm thick, over the surface of the neutron star.
  - B) It would rapidly sink to the center of Earth.
  - C) The combined mass of Earth and the neutron star would cause the neutron star to collapse into a black hole.
  - D) It would crash through Earth, creating a large crater, and exit Earth on the other side.
  - E) E) It would crash into Earth, throwing vast amounts of dust into the atmosphere which in turn would cool Earth. Such a scenario is probably what caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.
$${\color{orange}\text{A: We rule out D and E, or any scenario that leaves the Earth intact. B implies the force of the Earth's gravity is greater than that of the neutron star. The mass of the Earth is probably negligible enough for a black hole to not be an option here. A is the most likely answer.}}$$

- **19) From an observational standpoint, what is a *pulsar*?**
  - A) a star that slowly changes its brightness, getting dimmer and then brighter with a period of anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks
  - B) an object that emits flashes of light several times per second or more, with near perfect regularity
  - C) an object that emits random "pulses" of light that sometimes occur only a fraction of a second apart and other times stop for several days at a time
  - D) a star that changes color rapidly, from blue to red and back again
  - E) a star that rapidly changes size as it moves off the main sequence
$${\color{orange}\text{B: We rule out D and E because they're just incorrect. C doesn't hold because pulsars flash regularly. A doesn't hold because pulsars flash very quickly.}}$$

- **20) From a theoretical standpoint, what is a pulsar?**
  - A) a star that alternately expands and contracts in size
  - B) a rapidly rotating neutron star
  - C) a neutron star or black hole that happens to be in a binary system
  - D) a binary system that happens to be aligned so that one star periodically eclipses the other
  - E) a star that is burning iron in its core
$${\color{orange}\text{B: A describes Cepheid Variable Stars. C is something possible, but not what a pulsar is. D just describes a binary system. E is just not true.}}$$

- **21) What causes the radio pulses of a pulsar?**
  - A) The star vibrates.
  - B) As the star spins, beams of radio radiation sweep through space. If one of the beams crosses Earth, we observe a pulse.
  - C) The star undergoes periodic explosions of nuclear fusion that generate radio emission.
  - D) The star's orbiting companion periodically eclipses the radio waves by the main pulsar.
  - E) A black hole near the star absorbs energy and re-emits it as radio waves.
$${\color{orange}\text{B: Most probable answer as pulsars' key 'feature' is their sweeping rotation.}}$$

- **22) How do we know that pulsars are neutron stars?**
  - A) We have observed massive-star supernovae produce pulsars.
  - B) Pulsars and neutron stars look exactly the same.
  - C) No massive object, other than a neutron star, could spin as fast as we observe pulsars spin.
  - D) Pulsars have the same upper mass limit as neutron stars do.
  - E) none of the above
$${\color{orange}\text{C: We know it's not D because the upper mass limit for pulsars is } 3.2M_{sun} \text{and the upper mass limit for neutron stars is, like, } 1.6M_{sun}. \text{ B is a bit of a stretch (pulsars have that lighthouse effect), A isn't true because pulsars were found due to their strobing. C makes sense because neutron stars are super dense and super energetic.}}$$

- **23) What is the ultimate fate of an isolated pulsar?**
  - A) It will spin ever faster, becoming a millisecond pulsar.
  - B) As gravity overwhelms the neutron degeneracy pressure, it will explode as a supernova.
  - C) As gravity overwhelms the neutron degeneracy pressure, it will become a white dwarf.
  - D) It will slow down, the magnetic field will weaken, and it will become invisible.
  - E) The neutron degeneracy pressure will eventually overwhelm gravity and the pulsar will
slowly evaporate.
$${\color{orange}\text{D: A implies no upper limit (there always is one--c). Neutron stars result from supernovae of massive stars, so B doesn't work. C doesn't hold because white dwarfs and neutron stars are completely different yet 'parallel' things. E doesn't make sense because that's not how neutron degeneracy pressure works (the evaporation part).}}$$

- **24) What is the basic definition of a black hole?**
  - A) any compact mass that emits no light
  - B) a dead star that has faded from view
  - C) any object from which the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light
  - D) any object made from dark matter
  - E) a dead galactic nucleus that can only be viewed in infrared
$${\color{orange}\text{C: The key idea from pop culture about black holes is the inescapability of their tug; perhaps overblown for light and matter beyond their event horizon, but the idea is still relevant.}}$$

- **25) How does the gravity of an object affect light?**
  - A) Light doesn't have mass; therefore, it is not affected by gravity.
  - B) Light coming from a compact massive object, such as a neutron star, will be redshifted.
  - C) Light coming from a compact massive object, such as a neutron star, will be blueshifted.
  - D) Visible light coming from a compact massive object, such as a neutron star, will be redshifted, but higher frequencies such as X rays and gamma rays will not be affected.
  - E) Less energetic light will not be able to escape from a compact massive object, such as a neutron star, but more energetic light will be able to.
$${\color{orange}\text{B: Think about the light emitted from galaxies moving away from us. It is redshifted (elongated) as it travels through distorted spacetime. Same happens in a more general case with regard to this question.}}$$

- **26) How does a black hole form from a massive star?**
  - A) During a supernova, if a star is massive enough for its gravity to overcome neutron degeneracy of the core, the core will be compressed until it becomes a black hole.
  - B) Any star that is more massive than 8 solar masses will undergo a supernova explosion and leave behind a black-hole remnant.
  - C) If enough mass is accreted by a white-dwarf star so that it exceeds the 1.4-solar-mass limit, it will undergo a supernova explosion and leave behind a black-hole remnant.
  - D) If enough mass is accreted by a neutron star, it will undergo a supernova explosion and leave behind a black-hole remnant.
  - E) A black hole forms when two massive main-sequence stars collide.
$${\color{orange}\text{A: The key idea here is the massive amount of compression. Black holes don't occur from supernova explosions or star collisions, but from collapsed neutron stars.}}$$

- **27) Which of the following statements about black holes is not true?**
  - A) If you watch someone else fall into a black hole, you will never see him or her cross the event horizon. However, he or she will fade from view as the light he or she emits (or reflects) becomes more and more redshifted.
  - B) If we watch a clock fall toward a black hole, we will see it tick slower and slower as it falls nearer to the black hole.
  - C) A black hole is truly a hole in spacetime, through which we could leave the observable universe.
  - D) If the Sun magically disappeared and was replaced by a black hole of the same mass, Earth would soon be sucked into the black hole.
  - E) If you fell into a black hole, you would experience time to be running normally as you plunged rapidly across the event horizon.
$${\color{orange}\text{D: The time dilation due to the black hole's gravity would make it seem as if time is standing still for someone inside the event horizon (or nearly), to an outside observer. Hence, A and B are true. We can neither really confirm nor deny C, but it's kinda true in that we don't know where they go? E is true because time dilation only appears to happen relative to us (i.e. we'd never feel the dilation, we'd just see people move really fast or slow).}}$$

- **28) In some cases, a supernova in a binary system may lead to the eventual formation of an
*accretion disk* around the remains of the star that exploded. All of the following statements about
such accretion disks are true except**
  - A) X rays are emitted by the hot gas in the accretion disk.
  - B) the accretion disk consists of material that spills off the companion star.
  - C) the central object about which the accretion disk swirls may be either a neutron star or a black hole.
  - D) several examples of flattened accretion disks being "fed" by a large companion star can be seen clearly in photos from the Hubble Space Telescope.
  - E) the radiation from an accretion disk may vary rapidly in time.
$${\color{orange}\text{D: We can't see accretion disks because they're in the x-ray spectrum, not visible light (I think?)}}$$

- **29) When we see X rays from an accretion disk in a binary system, we can't immediately tell whether the accretion disk surrounds a neutron star or a black hole. Suppose we then observe each of the following phenomena in this system. Which one would force us to immediately rule out the possibility of a black hole?**
  - A) bright X-ray emission that varies on a time scale of a few hours
  - B) spectral lines from the companion star that alternately shift to shorter and longer wavelengths
  - C) sudden, intense X-ray bursts
  - D) visible and ultraviolet light from the companion star
$${\color{orange}\text{C: Sudden, intense bursts imply that stuff is getting out. It's not.}}$$

- **30) What is the Schwarzschild radius of a 100 million-solar-mass black hole? The mass of the
Sun is about $2 \times 10^{30}$ kg, and the formula for the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole of mass
M is:**

$$R_{s} = \dfrac{2GM}{c^2}, G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \dfrac{m^3}{kg \times s^2}, c = 3 \times 10^8 \dfrac{m}{s}$$

  - A) 3km
  - B) 30km
  - C) 3,000km
  - D) 300 million km
  - E) 3 million km
$${\color{orange}\text{D:} R_{s} = \dfrac{2 \cdot 6.67 \cdot 10^{-11} \cdot 100 \cdot 10^{6} \cdot 2 \cdot 10^{30}}{3 \cdot 10^8} \approx \text{300 million km}}$$

- **31) A 10-solar-mass main-sequence star will produce which of the following remnants?**
  - A) white dwarf
  - B) neutron star
  - C) black hole
  - D) none of the above
$${\color{orange}\text{B: massive main sequence } \implies \text{ neutron star. Regular main sequence } \implies \text{ white dwarf. Black holes form from collapsing neutron stars.}}$$

- **32) What do we mean by the *singularity* of a black hole?**
  - A) There are no binary black holes—each one is isolated.
  - B) An object can become a black hole only once, and a black hole cannot evolve into anything else.
  - C) It is the center of the black hole, a place of infinite density where the known laws of physics cannot describe the conditions.
  - D) It is the edge of the black hole, where one could leave the observable universe.
  - E) It is the "point of no return" of the black hole; anything closer than this point will not be able to escape the gravitational force of the black hole.
$${\color{orange}\text{C: black holes can be in binary systems, so not A. B may be true, but that's not what a singularity is. D describes the event horizon (maybe). E describes the event horizon.}}$$

- **33) How do we know what happens at the event horizon of a black hole?**
  - A) Physicists have created miniature black holes in the lab.
  - B) Astronomers have sent spacecraft through the event horizon of a nearby black hole.
  - C) Astronomers have analyzed the light from matter within the event horizon of many black holes.
  - D) Astronomers have detected X rays from accretion disks around black holes.
  - E) We don't know for sure: we only know what to expect based on the predictions of general relativity.
$${\color{orange}\text{E: We can't make black holes, we haven't sent anything through black holes, C wouldn't tell us about the inside, D wouldn't tell us about the inside.}}$$

- **34) Prior to the 1990s, most astronomers assumed that gamma-ray bursts came from neutron stars with accretion disks. How do we now know that this hypothesis was wrong?**
  - A) We now know that gamma-ray bursts come not from neutron stars but from black holes.
  - B) Theoretical work has proven that gamma rays cannot be produced in accretion disks.
  - C) Observations from the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory show that gamma-ray bursts come randomly from all directions in the sky.
  - D) Observations from the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory show that gamma-ray bursts occur too frequently to be attributed to neutron stars.
  - E) Observations from the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory have allowed us to trace gamma-ray bursts to pulsating variable stars in distant galaxies.
$${\color{orange}\text{C: This is just a bit of history/lore. They don't come from specific things we can identify (yet).}}$$

- **35) Why do astronomers consider gamma-ray bursts to be one of the greatest mysteries in astronomy?**
  - A) because they are so rare
  - B) because we know they come from pulsating variable stars but don't know how they are created
  - C) because the current evidence suggests that they are the most powerful bursts of energy that ever occur anywhere in the universe, but we don't know how they are produced
  - D) because current evidence suggests that they come from our own Milky Way, but we have no
idea where in the Milky Way they occur
  - E) because current evidence suggests that they come from massive black holes in the centers of
distant galaxies, adding to the mystery of black holes themselves
$${\color{orange}\text{C: They're not rare (as far as I know)--we just hadn't learned to detect them until recently. All of the other answers imply some level of knowledge about them, which takes away from the whole 'greatest mysteries' thing. We don't know anything, to my knowledge.}}$$

- **36) An advanced civilization lives on a planet orbiting a close binary star system that consists of a $15M_{Sun}$ red giant and a 10MSun black hole. Assume that the two stars are quite close together,
so that an accretion disk surrounds the black hole. The planet on which the civilization lives
orbits the binary star at a distance of 10 AU. Sometime within the next million years or so, their planet is likely to be doomed because:**
  - A) jets of material shot out of the accretion disk will shoot down their planet.
  - B) their planet receives most of its energy from the red giant. However, this star will soon be completely devoured in the accretion disk and thus will no longer exist.
  - C) the red giant will probably undergo a supernova explosion within the next million years.
  - D) tidal forces from the black hole will rip the planet apart.
  - E) the planet's orbit gradually will decay as it is sucked in by the black hole.
$${\color{orange}\text{C: The red giant is 'feeding' the black hole its own material, so it will die eventually. As it is a red giant, instead of becoming a white dwarf, it will meet its end as a supernova.}}$$

- **37) One foolhardy day, a daring major (let's call him Tom) in the space force decides to become the first of his race to cross the event horizon of the black hole. To add to the drama, he decides to go in wearing only a thin space suit, which offers no shielding against radiation, no cushioning against any forces, and so on. Which of the following is most likely to kill him first (or at least cause significant damage)? *(Hint: The key word here is first. Be sure to consider the distances from the black hole at which each of the noted effects is likely to become damaging.)***
  - A) the crush of gravity at the singularity embedded within the black hole
  - B) the tidal forces due to the black hole
  - C) the strong acceleration as he descends towards the black hole
  - D) the X rays from the accretion disk
  - E) the sucking force from the black hole, which will cause his head to explode
$${\color{orange}\text{The accretion disk stuff will hit Tom first; it's on the outside beyond the event horizon.}}$$

- **38) Through a bizarre (and scientifically unexplainable) fluctuation in the spacetime continuum, a copy of a book titled *Iguoonos: How We Evolved* appears on your desk.

  - D) They evolved on a different planet in a different star system and moved to their current location.
  - E) They evolved from primitive wormlike creatures that had 13 legs, 4 eyes, and bald heads, thus explaining why such critters are now considered a spectacular delicacy.
$${\color{orange}\text{D: Okay, so, A, B, and E are obviously not relevant. C doesn't really make sense.}}$$

- **39) If you were to come back to our Solar System in 6 billion years, what might you expect to find?**
  - A) a red giant star
  - B) a white dwarf
  - C) a rapidly spinning pulsar
  - D) a black hole
  - E) everything will be pretty much the same as it is now.
$${\color{orange}\text{B: This makes the most sense as the sun is a main sequence star with a mass indicative of a white dwarf.}}$$

- **40) Black holes, by definition, cannot be observed directly. What observational evidence do scientists have of their existence?**
