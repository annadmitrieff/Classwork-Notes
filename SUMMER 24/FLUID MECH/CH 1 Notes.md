#### Parameters of Flow
- $\ell$: length, or the physical size of the flow.
- $\nu$: velocity of the flow
- $\rho$: pressure of the flow

Fluids are easily deformed:
- Molecules are spaced further than in solids, intermolecular forces are weaker, molecules have freedom of movement.
- "A substance that deforms continuously when acted on by a shearing stress (tangential force) of any magnitude."

#### Common Quantities & Units
We define *primary quantities* to be:
- $\mathcal{L}$: length
- $\mathcal{T}$: time
- $\mathcal{M}$: mass
- $\vartheta$: temperature

Consequently, we consider our *secondary quantities*:
- $\mathcal{L}^2$: area
- $\dfrac{\mathcal{T}}{\mathcal{T}}$: velocity
- $\dfrac{\mathcal{M}}{\mathcal{L}^3}$: density
