## Applying MCFOST to PHANTOM
I used the [binary installation procedure](https://mcfost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) to install MCFOST:

    wget https://github.com/cpinte/mcfost/releases/latest/download/mcfost_macOS-X64.tar.gz

...And followed the additional recommended procedures for installation. 

    mcfost -get_para -rt
