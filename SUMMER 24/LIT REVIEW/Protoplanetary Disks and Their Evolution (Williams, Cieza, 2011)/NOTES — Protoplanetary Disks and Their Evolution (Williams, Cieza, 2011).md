## 1. Introduction
Circumstellar disks arise as a consequence of angular momentum conservation during the formation of stars due to gravitational collapse.
- Young disks rapidly funnel material onto the star's surface; as the surrounding molecular core is either used or dispersed, the rate of material accretion of the disc decreases and only a fraction of the material remains.
- These disks are what systems such as the Solar System originate from, evidenced by the high exoplanet population of these disks.

Circumstellar disks exhibit a variety of temperatures: they are hottest near the surface of the star and cooler further away, radiating at a range of wavelengths (microns to millimeters). 
- As a consequence, they are observable with infrared and radio telescopes.
- Mapping emitted wavelengths to their corresponding radii from the central star allows for detailed structural models derived solely from photometry.
- Disks' long lifespans and changing characteristics throughout their lifespans enable comparison between the star/protostar and the disk.

Recall that disks posess internal friction, or viscosity, which drives accretion onto the star. 
- Viscosity preserves angular momentum through various mechanisms in which material is lost through outflows, leading the disc to disperse over time.
- Disk structure may additionally be affected by photoevaporation (the process where energetic radiation ionizes gas and causes it to disperse away from the ionizing source) from the central star and external stars.
- Disk structure may additionally be affected by the agglomeration of dust grains with a range of sizes; these may accrete into small exoplanets which are large enough to cause gravitational preturbations in the disk. 

Sub-milimeter and infrared telescopes enabled statistical studies of disk occurrence.
- Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) was the first space telescope to study the sky in infrared wavelengths, detecting 350,000 infrared sources, evidence of dust grains around Vega and Fomalhaut.
- Millimeter wavelength detectors showed that many disks contained large dust grains with enough material to form planetary systems similar to our own.
- Long-wavelength interferometry provided the ability to resolve disk rotation.
- Hubble Space Telescope (Hubble) provided evidence for their flattened morphology.
- Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer) have expanded the disk inventory in terms of central stellar mass, age, environment, and evolutionary state due to increases in sensitivity, resolution, and wavelength coverage.
- Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA) has enabled the expansion of interferometry to longer baselines and shorter wavelengths, enabling us to map fainter structures in greater detail.
- Herschel Space Observatory (Herschel) and the Atacama Large Milimeter/Submilimeter Array (ALMA) are the next steps in protoplanetary disk observations.

## 2. Classification of Young Stellar Objects
Recall that star and planet formation begins with the collapse of a molecular core, where the mass originally resides, before later being processed through an accretion disk inward onto the protostar and outward through an outflow. 
- The core is dispersed and the remaining mass is concentrated in the star.
- The most direct manner of characterizing the progression of a disk is measuring the mass in each component, but this is difficult, and more practical means are generally used which include principally measuring disk accretion signatures in the optical range, or by evaluating the distribution of warm circumstellar material in the infrared range.

Lada & Wilking (1984) were the first to coin infrared-based classification by demonstrating that Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) in Ophiuchus formed 3 distinct groups based on whether the emitted energy was rising in the mid-infrared, declining but with a notable excess over the blackbody stellar photosphere, or with negligible infrared excess.
- Classes I, II, and III were formalized by Lada based on the slope of spectral energy distribution (SED) between 2 and 25 $\micro$m:

$$\alpha_{IR} = \dfrac{d \log \nu F_{\nu}}{d \log \nu} = \dfrac{d \log \lambda F_{\lambda}}{d \log \lambda}$$
- $\lambda \text{= wavelength}$
- $F_{\lambda} \text = flux density$

The $\alpha$ is calculated in the wavelength interval of 2.2-20$\mu$m (the near- and mid-infrared region).
- Andre et al. (1993) discovered a class 0 of objects with submillimeter emissions, but very faint at $\lambda < 10 \mu m$.
- Greene et all defined a fifth class of 'flat spectrum' sources:

**Class 0** Sources are undetectable at $\lambda$ < 20 $\mu$ m.
**Class I** Sources have $\alpha$ > 0.3.
**Flat Spectrum** Sources have 0.3 > $\alpha$ > -0.3.
**Class II** Sources have -0.3 > $\alpha$ > -1.6.
**Class III** Sources have $\alpha$ < -1.6.

A parallel accretion-based classification was additionally defined for the optically-visible phases: classical and weak-lined T Tauri stars.
