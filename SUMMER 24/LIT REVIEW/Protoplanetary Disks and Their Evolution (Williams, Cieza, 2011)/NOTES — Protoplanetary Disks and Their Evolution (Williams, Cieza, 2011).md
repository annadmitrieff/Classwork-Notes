## 1. Introduction
Circumstellar discs arise as a consequence of angular momentum conservation during the formation of stars due to gravitational collapse.
- Young discs rapidly funnel material onto the star's surface; as the surrounding molecular core is either used or dispersed, the rate of material accretion of the disc decreases and only a fraction of the material remains.
- These discs are what systems such as the Solar System originate from, evidenced by the high exoplanet population of these discs.

Circumstellar discs exhibit a variety of temperatures: they are hottest near the surface of the star and cooler further away, radiating at a range of wavelengths (microns to millimeters). 
- As a consequence, they are observable with infrared and radio telescopes.
- Mapping emitted wavelengths to their corresponding radii from the central star allows for detailed structural models derived solely from photometry.
- Disks' long lifespans and changing characteristics throughout their lifespans enable comparison between the star/protostar and the disc.

Recall that discs posess internal friction, or viscosity, which drives accretion onto the star. 
- Viscosity preserves angular momentum through various mechanisms in which material is lost through outflows, leading the disc to disperse over time.
- Disk structure may additionally be affected by photoevaporation (the process where energetic radiation ionizes gas and causes it to disperse away from the ionizing source) from the central star and external stars.
- Disk structure may additionally be affected by the agglomeration of dust grains with a range of sizes; these may accrete into small exoplanets which are large enough to cause gravitational preturbations in the disc. 

Sub-milimeter and infrared telescopes enabled statistical studies of disc occurrence.
- Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) was the first space telescope to study the sky in infrared wavelengths, detecting 350,000 infrared sources, evidence of dust grains around Vega and Fomalhaut.
- Millimeter wavelength detectors showed that many discs contained large dust grains with enough material to form planetary systems similar to our own.
- Long-wavelength interferometry provided the ability to resolve disc rotation.
- Hubble Space Telescope (Hubble) provided evidence for their flattened morphology.
- Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer) have expanded the disc inventory in terms of central stellar mass, age, environment, and evolutionary state due to increases in sensitivity, resolution, and wavelength coverage.
- Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA) has enabled the expansion of interferometry to longer baselines and shorter wavelengths, enabling us to map fainter structures in greater detail.
- Herschel Space Observatory (Herschel) and the Atacama Large Milimeter/Submilimeter Array (ALMA) are the next steps in protoplanetary disc observations.

## 2. Classification of Young Stellar Objects
Recall that star and planet formation begins with the collapse of a molecular core, where the mass originally resides, before later being processed through an accretion disc inward onto the protostar and outward through an outflow. 
- The core is dispersed and the remaining mass is concentrated in the star.
- The most direct manner of characterizing the progression of a disc is measuring the mass in each component, but this is difficult, and more practical means are generally used which include principally measuring disc accretion signatures in the optical range, or by evaluating the distribution of warm circumstellar material in the infrared range.

Lada & Wilking (1984) were the first to coin infrared-based classification by demonstrating that Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) in Ophiuchus formed 3 distinct groups based on whether the emitted energy was rising in the mid-infrared, declining but with a notable excess over the blackbody stellar photosphere, or with negligible infrared excess.
- Classes I, II, and III were formalized by Lada based on the slope of spectral energy distribution (SED) between 2 and 25 $\mu$ m:

$$\alpha_{IR} = \dfrac{d \log \nu F_{\nu}}{d \log \nu} = \dfrac{d \log \lambda F_{\lambda}}{d \log \lambda}$$
- $\lambda \text{= wavelength}$
- $F_{\lambda} \text{ = flux density}$

The $\alpha$ is calculated in the wavelength interval of 2.2-20 $\mu$ m (the near- and mid-infrared region). 
- Andre et al. (1993) discovered a Class 0 of objects with sub-millimeter emissions, but very faint ( $\lambda<10 \mu$ m).
- Greene et all defined a fifth class of 'flat spectrum' sources:

**Class 0** Sources are undetectable at $\lambda$ < 20 $\mu$ m.

**Class I** Sources have $\alpha$ > 0.3.

**Flat Spectrum** Sources have 0.3 > $\alpha$ > -0.3.

**Class II** Sources have -0.3 > $\alpha$ > -1.6.

**Class III** Sources have $\alpha$ < -1.6.

A parallel accretion-based classification was additionally defined for the optically-visible phases: classical and weak-lined T Tauri stars. Overall, these classes correspond to different ages of a protostar's evolution:
- **Class 0** YSOs are in the earliest and most embedded stage of star formation, characterized by a high amount of mass in the surrounding envelope of gas and dust, with a very low amount of radiation emerging from the protostar itself. 
- **Class I** YSOs are deeply embedded in their envelopes still, with central protostars beginning to emerge and become more prominent. They exhibit strong infrared emission from the surrounding material.
- YSOs graduate to **Class II** stars when the protostellar photosphere first bceomes visible after the surrounding envelope has mostly dissipated, leaving a prominent protoplanetary disc around the young star. These YSOs show less infrared emission than earlier stages, but still more than later stages.
- **Class III**s are the most evolved YSOs and resemble young main-sequence stars. They have mostly dissipated circumstellar discs and lower infrared emissions similar to that of a normal star, with little to no exceess infrared emission.

## 3. Disk Formation
Circumstellar discs form almost immediately after a molecular core collapse. Their existence can be inferred through both SED modeling and interferometry.
- The initial collapse of the core is onto a point source, but as more distant material with higher angular momentum falls inward, the disc accretes rapidly.
- The forming disc extends to the centrifugal radius which grows quickly with time:

$$R(t) \propto \Omega^{2}t^{3}$$
- $\Omega = \text{angular rotation rate of core}$

- Final size and mass of the disc depends sensitively on the infall time ($t^{3}$) and the core properties ($\Omega^{2}$).
- The role of magnetic fields in core collapse and disc formation is uncertain, as numerical models of both magnetic and non-magnetic collapsing molecular cores show that discs form rapidly (within $~10^{4}$ years).
- Some papers describe the formation of magnetic field lines as concentrated at the center of the collapsing cloud core, while other observations show that magnetic field strength is insufficient to support some cores against their own gravity.
- Core collapse onto a disc opens up an approximately spherical cavity in the surrounding envelope of radius $R(t)$.
  - This has been inferred from the presence of excessive mid-infrared emission higher than the emissions expected from a more extincted, centrally-peaked core.
- Despite speculation and observations pointing toward inward motions on core-size scales, gas flow onto a disc has yet to be demonstrated.
    - There have been many observations indicating inward motions of gas on larger scales around star-forming regions.
    - **Chandler et al. (2005)** found sulfur monoxide (SO) line absorption against the disc continuum in the YSO IRAS 16293-2422B. However, the spectral profile was symmetrical around the source velocity, making it difficult to conclusively identify this as pure infall (i.e. direct gas flow onto the disc).
    - **Watson et al. (2007)** detected multiple mid-infrared water lines toward NGC1333-IRAS4B, which they modeled as originating from a dense, warm, and compact region. They suggested this could be due to shocked gas resulting from the interaction between the envelope and the disc surface.
    - **Jørgensen & van Dishoeck (2010)** mapped a specific water transition ($H_{2}^{18}O$) at 1.5mm from the ground and found that the water emission was calm ("quiescent") and followed the disc's rotation, rather than indicating any dynamic inflow.

- Imaging embedded discs around YSOs introduces a few key techniques and challenges:
    - To image embedded discs, long wavelengths are required to penetrate the surrounding envelopes, and high-resolution imaging (arcsecond or better) is needed to match the disc sizes.
    - Millimeter interferometers meet these requirements because they can see through the envelopes and achieve high resolution. They also filter out extended structures, allowing the emission from the compact disc to dominate on long baselines (greater than ~50kilo $\lambda$ ). This has been demonstrated in studies by Brown et al. (2000), Jørgensen et al. (2005), Keene & Masson (1990), and Looney, Mundy, & Welch (2000).
    - A 1.1mm continuum survey of 20 embedded YSOs by Jørgensen et al. (2009) found that disc flux is, on average, four times higher in the embedded Class 0 phase than in Class I sources. However, when accounting for higher temperatures due to greater accretion heating, the inferred disc masses showed no significant dependence on the evolutionary state.
    - The disc masses in both Class 0 and Class I sources range from approximately 0.02 to 0.1 Solar Masses, with a median value of 0.04 Solar Masses. These results are quantitatively similar to those from 2.7mm observations of six sources by Looney, Mundy, & Welch (2003).

Disc masses do not appear to increase with time during core collapse, implying a rapid transport onto the star.
- Basu (1998) notes that magnetized collapsing cores may not be in rigid rotation and that the radius may only grow linearly with time.
- Given the wide range of core rotation rates and likely variation in infall duration, it is natural that there is significant diversity and variation in initial disk sizes and masses.
- Contrary to theoretical expectations, the disc mass does not significantly increase from Class 0 to Class I stages, despite a decline in envolope mass by almost an order of magnitude (Young et al. 2003).
- This suggests that discs form quickly and material from the envelope is rapidly transported through the disc.

Disc instability is likely responsible for the rapid transport of material in the early stages.
- Laughlin & Bodenheimer (1994) proposed that early-stage discs are gravitationally unstable due to a high mass fraction in the disc relative to the protostar.
- Instabilities lead to sporadic bursts of high accretion (Zhu et al. 2009), preventing the disc mass from growing faster than the star (Vorobyov & Basu 2010).

Many protostars experience short-lived bursts of high accretion, known as FU Orionis events (Herbig 1977).
- Hartmann & Kenyon (1996) estimated that a typical low-mass star undergoes about 10 such outbursts during its formation.

Eisner et al. (2005) found that envelope infall rates are much higher than disc accretion rates in Class I YSOs, indicating that mass builds up in the disc until a burst event occurs.
- Class I YSOs are generally about an order of magnitude less luminous than expected for steady gravitational energy release (Kenyon et al. 1990).

Evans et al. (2009) concluded that a star gains half of its final mass in only about 7% of the combined class 0 and I lifetime (~0.5Myr).
- This rapid mass gain can be explained by models of episodic mass accretion from self-gravitating discs (Dunham et al. 2010).

The low average luminosity of YSOs and the accretion bursts of FU Orionis objects suggest that young discs are gravitationally unstable.

Overall, more secure identifications of embedded discs require spectral line observations showing rotation.
- The emission from the core and any protostellar outflow still presents significant confusion, although this is mitigated by observing species such as HCN and HCO $^{+}$ that only emit substantially in gas that is warmer and denser than the outer parts of the envelope.

## 4. Properties of Protoplanetary Disks
### 4.1: Mass
Disc masses are best measured from (sub-)millimeter observations of thermal continuum emission from dust. Substantial and uncertain corrections are required for the grain size distribution and gas-to-dust ratio.
- Assuming an ISM gas-to-dust ratio of 100 and ignoring the mass in bodies larger than 1mm, the median mass of protoplanetary discs around Class II YSOs with spectral types GKM is 5 Jupiter Masses.
- From brown dwarfs to B stars, disc masses scale with the stellar mass. The median ratio is about 1% but there is a large dispersion, $\pm$ 0.5 dex.

### 4.2: Radius
### 4.3: Structure
Protoplanetary discs have power law surface density profiles with an exponential taper that produce a soft edge anywhere from 20 to 200 AU from the star. The power law index is approximately -1 but is extrapolated and highly uncertain within the central ~ 20 AU.
- Surface densities are generally below the threshold for gravitational instability and velocity profiles are keplerian. 

### 4.4: Composition
Mid-infrared through milimeter spectroscopy reveals a warm molecular layer with PDR-like chemistry that is strongly dependent on the stellar luminosity and a cold midplane depleted of molecules.
